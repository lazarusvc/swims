# Concept Note for the Digitalization of the Social Welfare Processes

**Social Welfare Information Management System (SWIMS)**

## Background

Dominica, an upper-middle-income small island state, has made significant strides in poverty reduction over the past decade. While economic growth, measured at a national economy of approximately USD 596 million annually (World Bank, 2019), has contributed to this progress, challenges remain. Although poverty rates have decreased from 39% in 2003 to around 28% in 2009, with indigence reduced to 1.6%, child poverty remains a concern at approximately 38%.

Dominica’s resilience has been repeatedly tested. The devastating impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017, causing damage estimated at 226% of the 2016 GDP, severely disrupted livelihoods and infrastructure, leading to a temporary surge in poverty. Subsequently, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated vulnerabilities, particularly within the tourism sector, underscoring the critical need for robust, shock-responsive social safety nets. The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica has actively addressed these challenges through various income-support programs, notably the Public Assistance Programme (PAP).

The World Food Programme (WFP) has been a key partner in Dominica's efforts to enhance social protection and disaster response. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, WFP partnered with the government to deliver social cash transfers, reaching 3,413 households (9,631 individuals) across five rounds in 2020 and 2021. This collaboration demonstrated the efficacy of targeted interventions during crises. Further, following the 2022 trough system, WFP provided EC$405,000 in immediate financial assistance to affected populations. Notably, in 2021, WFP and Dominica pioneered a financial mechanism linking sovereign climate risk insurance payouts to social protection programs, ensuring rapid assistance following climate-related disasters.

Building upon these successful collaborations, the government is committed to strengthening national social protection and disaster risk management systems. Leveraging the success of digitalized registration for Social Cash Transfers, WFP is currently supporting the development of a Social Welfare Information Management System (SWIMS) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This initiative aims to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of social protection delivery, enabling faster and more accurate identification and support of vulnerable populations.

To further advance these efforts, the Government of Dominica is seeking continued technical assistance and support for the development and implementation of Version 1 of SWIMS. This project will focus on system development, capacity building for social service personnel, and the integration of shock-responsive social protection. By enhancing the operational efficiency of the Social Welfare Services Department, this initiative will ensure timely and effective support for Dominica's most vulnerable populations, reinforcing the longstanding and impactful partnership between WFP and the Government of Dominica.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance the Social Welfare Services Department efficiency by developing tailored tools to facilitate intake, registration, assessment, and validation of applicants in the form of a digitalized system (also known as MIS) for Social Welfare.

## Approach

According to the Strategy developed earlier in 2024, WFP supported DSS in a phased approach to transition towards the full digitalization of their processes, allowing sustainability and ownership from the users.

### First Phase (Completed): Setting the Basis for the Digitalization of Processes

The first phase was conducted during the second semester of 2024 and achieved through the following activities:

1. **Documentation of the current end-to-end process** for Public Assistance delivery (intake to reconciliation), covering regular grants, medical support, education, and other ad-hoc supports. Identification of challenges, pain points, and recommendations for enhancing each step.
2. **Development of a revised end-to-end process** to address those challenges, relying on the usage of a digitalized system:
   - Digital data collection.
   - Recommendation of support.
   - Different levels of validation.
   - Status changes.
   - Collection of payment information.
   - Preparation of administrative work for processing payments.
   - Reconciliation of payments.
   - Inclusion of case management with accompanying services, referrals, reassessment, and exit strategies.
3. **Drafting a comprehensive system structure** for existing Social Welfare services:
   - Improve applicant deduplication.
   - Workflow automation.
   - Performance monitoring and reporting.
   - Cross-departmental coordination.
   - Scalability and future enhancements.
   - Disaster response integration.
   - User access levels.
4. **Digitization of two forms** using the Kobo Toolbox software to enable digital data collection at:
   - The intake step (for the entire DSS).
   - The registration step (for Social Welfare).
   A local Kobo server has been set up by ICT for data storage. Forms are in testing before deployment. Data collected will feed into the digital system for cleaning, analysis/assessment, recommendation, validation, and case management.

### Second Phase: Development of SWIMS

This phase will implement the re-engineered processes and tools through a system, building on existing systems, skilled staff experience, and WFP support. Key functionalities include:

- Intake, registration, assessment, recommendation, and validation modules.
- Case management.
- Reporting automation.
- Interoperability with existing systems (e.g., VCAS, Smart-Stream).
- Administrative and reconciliation process support.

Although digitalized forms can enhance initial process stages once testing is complete, the full system will be developed, tested, and launched over approximately six months following development commencement.

The strategy is to leverage the existing Pension Assistance (65+) platform (ASP.NET MVC5) of the Ministry of Finance, complemented by custom coding to meet DSS requirements. This platform currently supports application digitization, approval workflows, payment processing, report generation, and security roles.

### Third Phase: Enhancement of SWIMS

Upon version 1 launch, SWIMS can be enhanced based on implementation learnings. Potential enhancements include:

- Integration of other DSS units and services.
- Grievance Redress Mechanism.
- Enhanced shock-responsiveness (e.g., e-wallet payments via financial service provider integration).

An amendment to the Technical Assistance may support these activities.

## Conclusion

This phased strategy adheres to principles that ensure:

- Maximum comprehension, ownership, and sustainability by DSS.
- Recognition of a complex effort delivered in versions.
- Coverage of many modules and services.
- Maximized data privacy and protection.
- Reduced risk of financial loss, corruption, and collusion.
- User-centric design with iterative feedback.
- Built-in data quality control.
- Fit-for-use functionality.
- Flexibility and adaptability to changing needs.
- Reduced vendor/provider lock-in.
- Controlled long-term costs.

Roles, responsibilities, and a work plan for 2025–2026 are defined in separate documents.
